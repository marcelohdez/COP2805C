# COP2805C

My mono-repo for my COP2805C (Java 2) college class.

## Running

In your IDE you may run the any assignment's Main file directly. If using \*vim
or are just in a terminal follow the steps below.

### Java 8 - 21

Run the Makefile at this repo's root to build and run a specific assignment for you:

```bash
make
```

### Java 22+

Java 22 can **_finally_** run multi-file projects by itself, so you may run e.g.:

```bash
java Assignment1/edu/mdc/cop2805c/assignment1/Main.java
```

And it will run the project correctly.
