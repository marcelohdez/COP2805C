# COP2805C

My mono-repo for my COP2805C (Java 2) college class.

## Running

_You should have Java 8+ installed._

In your IDE you may run the any assignment's Main file directly. Otherwise
follow the steps below

### Unix

Run the `run.sh` script at this repo's root in your terminal:

```bash
./run.sh <assignment number>
```

### Java 22+

Java 22 can **_finally_** run multi-file projects by itself, so you may run e.g.:

```bash
java /path/to/Main.java
```

And it will run the project correctly.

### Others

Java moment... compile all files and run the Main class file.
